# PageKey Blog / Website

This is the main PageKey website, hosted at [pagekey.io](https://pagekey.io).

It also contains the Markdown source for all of our long-form blog posts.

It is an Eleventy website based on the [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).

The homepage design is heavily inspired by an Astro template. See the `last-astro-commit` tag if you want to check out the old Astro site.

This repo has been through many redesigns - explore the commit history to find Docusaurus, Hugo, and many of SSG adventures.
